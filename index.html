            <h4>BIG TITLE<small>REST OF TITLE</small></h4>

            <p>We could put something interesting here like a long paragraph about one of the sections. Right now I might put something here to just take up the space. New research shows what many people in the computer science field already know—a passion for computers starts early in life. So how can you tell if your son or daughter is a budding programmer?
There are a few common traits that future coders and developers have in common during their formative years, according to a July 2015 survey of more than 2,200 developers who use Code School, which offers online courses in programming.
For starters, most coders took an interest in computers before the age of 16 and that passion stayed with them.
And they got good grades. More than two-thirds of male coders and 81% of female coders reported earning grade point averages (GPAs) of 3.6 or higher (out of a possible 4.0) in high school. But don’t fret if your kid is not an honors student. Of those polled, the programmers who posted lower high school GPAs often brought in more money than their over-achieving peers. More than 62% of developers who had high school GPAs of 2.9 or lower took home $100,000 or more a year compared to 41% of those who had GPAs of 3.6 or higher, the survey found.</p>
